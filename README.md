# Webscraping-Indeed-Jobs
Hello, I made a simple python script that uses the BeautifulSoup Package to scrape job postings and their details from indeed.ca. This is then exported into a .csv file where everything is displayed. I have followed the Izzy Analytics video on scraping jobs from INDEED as my primary point of reference and suited to my use. The links to their github and youtube video is below.
